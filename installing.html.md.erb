This topic describes how to install and configure Redis Enterprise Software (RS) Service Broker, as well as how to create an instance of the Redis Enterprise service from the Marketplace of your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment.

For this release, the tile version has been updated to match the version number of Redis Enterprise.

##<a id='installing-rp'></a>Install Redis Enterprise

To use the Redis Enterprise Service Broker, you must have a Redis Enterprise cluster already deployed. Configuring the Redis Enterprise Service Broker requires a Redis Enterprise admin account username and password, as well as the URL of your RS cluster.

For more information about how to install Redis Enterprise and create a cluster on PCF, see the [RS on PCF documentation](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-documentation/getting-started/pcf/).

##<a id='create-db'></a> Create a Redis Database in Apps Manager

After installing the Redis Enterprise Service Broker, Redis Enterprise appears as a service in the Marketplace of your deployment. Developers can provision Redis databases by creating service instances using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI).

Follow the instructions below to create a Redis Labs Enterprise Cluster service instance using Apps Manager.

1. Navigate to Apps Manager in a browser and log in.
1. Click **Marketplace**.
1. Click **Redis Enterprise**.
1. Choose one of the four preconfigured database plans and click **Select this plan**. For more information about the preconfigured plans, see the [Overview](index.html#overview).
1. In the **Configure Instance** form, enter an **Instance Name** to identify the service instance in the deployment as well as the database name in RS. To override the default parameters and provide additional database configuration parameters, click **Show Advanced Options**. Contact support@redislabs.com for further instructions on using this feature.
1. Once you create the service and bind it to an app, you can find the credentials in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable in the following format:

```
"VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "redislabs-enterprise-cluster": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     "host": "redis-12345.pcf-rlec.redislabs.com",
     "ip_list": [
      "10.0.0.171"
     ],
     "password": "some-redis-password",
     "port": 12345
    },
    "label": "redislabs-enterprise-cluster",
    "name": "my-redis-db",
    "plan": "ha-redis",
    "provider": null,
    "syslog_drain_url": null,
    "tags": [
     "redislabs"
    ]
   }
  ]
}
```
