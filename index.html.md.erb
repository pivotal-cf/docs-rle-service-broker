This documentation describes the Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack (RP) for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). The RP Service Broker registers a service broker on PCF and exposes its service plans on the Marketplace. Developers can provision Redis databases by creating instances of the service plans using Apps Manager or the cf Command Line Interface (CLI).

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack is an enterprise-grade cluster that acts as a container for managing and running multiple Redis databases in a highly available and scalable manner.

The Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack Service Broker exposes four service plans on the Marketplace. The service plans correspond to the following preconfigured database plans:

* Simple Redis database: a single master shard.
* Highly-available Redis database: master/slave shards or master/multi-slave shards.
* Redis clustered database: multiple master shards.
* Highly-available Redis clustered database: multiple master shards each with its own slave shard, or multiple master/multi-slave shards.

For more information, see the [Redis<sup>e</sup> Pack documentation](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-documentation/overview/).
